# CRG: Linker-Driven Discovery and Hardware-Bound Logic Mapping

### An Architecture for Universal Decoupling and Zero-Cost Capability Routing

**Cyril Tissier** | April 2026

## 1. Abstract

The **Capability Routing Grid (CRG)** is a general-purpose architectural pattern designed to resolve the fundamental conflict between modular decoupling and hardware efficiency. By treating data and logic as two parallel dimensions—mirroring the L1I/L1D split of modern CPUs—CRG eliminates the "Virtual Deadlock" inherent in traditional object-oriented hierarchies. It provides a linker-driven, zero-allocation framework for any C++ system requiring decoupled module discovery and high-performance capability routing, from plugin-based tools to massive scale simulations.

CRG delivers three uncompromising guarantees: **Zero Coupling, Zero Search, and Zero Migration**.

## 2. Pillar I: Linker-Driven Discovery (Universal Decoupling)

CRG relocates Inversion of Control (IoC) to the linker level to eliminate the build-time bottlenecks of centralized registries.

* **Zero-Include Registration:** Modules self-register via a `NodeList` pattern. A feature or plugin is added to the system simply by linking its binary, with zero modifications required to core headers or source code.
* **Linker-Resolved Plugins:** This architecture provides a fully functional plugin system as a side effect. Define a struct, instantiate it as a static—the OS wires the capability before `main()`, and the gateway discovers it only when requested, without the core ever needing to know the module exists.

---

## 3. Pillar II: Thematic Identity Governance (TypeList & DenseTypeID)

CRG partitions identity through `TypeList` groupings to maintain data density and execution predictability.

* **The Collapse:** The architecture collapses the sparse, unpredictable universe of `typeid` hashes into a dense, contiguous array index via `DenseTypeID`. This ensures that the behavioral tensor remains a tight, direct-access matrix.
* **Domain Isolation:** Distinct domains operate in isolated index spaces, preventing behavioral tables from becoming sparse even in systems with hundreds of independent modules.

## 4. Pillar III: The ModelShell (Breaking the Virtual Deadlock)

The **ModelShell** is the vehicle for high-performance data transport across decoupled systems. Inspired by Klaus Iglberger’s Type Erasure, it is a "shell" stripped of all behavioral logic.

* **Identity without Logic:** The shell carries only data and identity. It breaks the "Virtual Deadlock" where C++ forbids virtual template methods. One virtual jump identifies the type; one static_cast recovers the data.
* **Hardware Symmetry:** By using Small Buffer Optimization (SBO) and cache-line alignment, the `ModelShell` ensures that data transport mirrors the physical requirements of the CPU prefetcher.
* **The OOP Illusion:** In the cold path, `ModelShell` provides `Invoke` and `TryInvoke` APIs. These analyze method pointers at compile-time to resolve interfaces automatically, offering a clean OOP syntax without the architectural tax.

## 5. Pillar IV: N-Dimensional Behavioral Projection

Behavioral resolution is modeled as a coordinate lookup within an **N-Dimensional Tensor** (CapabilitySpace).

* **Pure Arithmetic Dispatch:** Contextual axes (State, Zone, Authority) are resolved via Horner’s method into a flat offset. Complexity is free: whether you have one or ten dimensions, the lookup remains two array accesses.
* **Immutable Topology:** Behavior transitions are coordinate updates, not structural rewirings. The memory addresses of the logic never shift, allowing the prefetcher to maintain a perfect stream.

---

## 6. Pillar V: ECS Symbiosis (Brain & Muscle)

When applied to ECS architectures, CRG decouples the "Decision" (Logic Projection) from the "Execution" (Data Pipeline).

* **The Brain (Decision):** A low-frequency system (e.g., 5 Hz) evaluates the context and performs the O(1) tensor lookup. The result is cached inside the entity using an `ActiveCapability` component.
* **The Muscle (Execution):** A high-frequency system (60 Hz) iterates contiguous arrays and calls the cached result.
* **Direct Function Pointer (Stage 12):** To reach the hardware limit, `ActiveCapability` now stores the raw function address (`pfnResolved`) instead of a descriptor pointer. This reduces hot-loop execution to a single-jump call, eliminating an additional memory dereference and maximizing prefetcher efficiency.
* **Bulletproof Contracts:** The `ActiveCapability` uses strict SFINAE (IsDODContract) to ensure that high-performance static dispatch cannot be accidentally confused with polymorphic OOP interfaces.

## 7. Performance & Benchmarks

CRG reaches the hardware limit by ensuring **Structural Immunity**: data never moves to change its behavior.

* **Level 1 (OOP / vtable):** ~20 ns/entity.
* **Level 2 (ModelShell Invoke):** ~7 ns/entity (Cold path routing).
* **Level 3 (ActiveCapability Stage 12):** Zero-overhead single-jump dispatch. The CPU reads the function address directly from the entity component and jumps, bypassing all intermediate structures and saturating memory bandwidth.

| Dataset Size          | Implementation     | Throughput     | Overhead vs CRG |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| **64k (Cache-bound)** | ECS (10% mutation) | 35.23 Gi/s     | **1.99x**       |

| **1M (Memory-bound)** | ECS (10% mutation) | 19.26 Gi/s     | **1.60x**       |
|                       | **CRG Projection** | **30.83 Gi/s** | **Baseline**    |

## 8. Architectural Decision Matrix (ECS vs CRG)

CRG does not deprecate ECS; it complements it. The architectural decision between traditional ECS archetype migration and CRG pointer caching depends on two variables: **Entity Size** (Data Payload) and **Structural Mutation Rate** (State Volatility).

* **ECS Supremacy (Static Loops & Micro-Entities):** For data payloads strictly under 64-bytes exhibiting highly static behavior (< 4% mutation rate), ECS archetype processing is mathematically optimal. The occasional `memcpy` penalty is offset by zero-indirection loops.
* **CRG Supremacy (Zero-Migration & Heavy Logic):** Once an entity exceeds the 64-byte L1 cache-line threshold, or if state volatility exceeds 4%, the memory-wall constraints dominate CPU performance. By caching a raw function pointer rather than migrating data structures, CRG preserves prefetcher momentum and linear memory access.

## 9. FAQ

**Q: Is CRG only for Game Engines?**
No. It is for any C++ system where modules must remain completely independent. It allows a module to "exist" and be discovered by the system without the module ever needing to know the system's internals, and vice versa.

**Q: What is the "Virtual Deadlock"?**
The impossibility in C++ to have a virtual template method. `ModelShell` resolves this by splitting identity (virtual) from data recovery (template).

**Q: How does it handle Hot-Reload?**
Live++ patches function bodies in place. For topology changes, the developer triggers a `Bake` to rebuild the tensor matrix from the linked list of nodes.
